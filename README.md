# Customer Insights with K-Means: Segmentation for Data-Driven Decision Making

Welcome to my **Customer Segmentation Analysis** project! This repository demonstrates my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization by applying the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to segment customers based on their spending behavior and income levels.

## ðŸŒŸ **Overview**
In this project, I analyze customer data from a retail context to identify distinct customer groups. By leveraging clustering techniques, I generate actionable insights that businesses can use to enhance customer satisfaction, tailor marketing campaigns, and optimize resources.

This project showcases:
- My proficiency in **data preprocessing**, **model implementation**, and **visualization**.
- The ability to extract **meaningful insights** from raw data.
- Expertise in **statistical reasoning** and **practical applications** of machine learning models.

## ðŸ”‘ **Key Features**
- **Elbow Method**: Identifies the optimal number of clusters for segmentation.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups customers into 5 meaningful clusters.
- **Visualizations**: Intuitive plots that highlight clusters and centroids.
- **Actionable Insights**: Recommendations for marketing, resource allocation, and product strategies.

## ðŸ“Š **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: For data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Implementation of K-Means Clustering.


## ðŸ“ˆ **Results**
- **Optimal Clusters:** Identified 5 customer segments using the Elbow Method.
- **Cluster Insights:**
  - Cluster 1: Low income, high spenders.
  - Cluster 2: High income, high spenders.
  - Cluster 3: Moderate income and spenders.
  - Cluster 4: Low income, low spenders.
  - Cluster 5: High income, low spenders.
- **Practical Applications:**
  - Personalized marketing strategies.
  - Improved resource allocation.
  - Enhanced customer retention.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates my ability to apply data analysis techniques to real-world problems, delivering insights that drive decision-making. I hope this repository highlights my technical expertise and strategic thinking as a **Data Analyst**.
